# smash.json

A maintained JSON list of all Smash Bros characters with abbreviations, common shortened names, smash.gg Ids, etc.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to make an easy to import JSON set that can be used by other developers.
This contains most data of the characters within the JSON format.
This goes from simple descriptions and links to frame data.

## Usage

Smash.json is made as a base for the FightCore seed data. FightCore will offer these to the user as an editable wiki. Once these files get edited a lot it will be reuploaded to the `Output` folder.
